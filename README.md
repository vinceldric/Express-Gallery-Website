- used template from [HTML5up](https://html5up.net/).

#### Short Summary
I've reused my [assignment 3](https://github.com/vinceldric/cpnt262-a3) files and added a new module which is the `ejs`. This module makes it easier for us to separate the `header`, `nav`, and `footer` and put it in one folder and just call it inside the HTML file. This is deployed to a live Heroku App server.
